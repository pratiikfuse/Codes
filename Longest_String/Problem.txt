Write a program to get the longest string from the list which starts with the given character.Assume that input comparison is done irrespective of case. ie case insensitive.



Include a class UserProgramCode with a static method getLongestString which accepts a String list and a character. The return type is a string.


Create a Class Program which would be used to accept the size of the string list, the list elements and the search character and calls the static method present in UserProgramCode.



In getLongestString
If there is no element found list, then return the string "No elements found "
Only alphabets should be given in the list. Otherwise return the string, "String contains non alphabetic characters. "
3.I f the two or more strings start with the given character ,the longest string should be returned. Assume that the longest string will be unique.
